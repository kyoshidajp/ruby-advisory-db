title: Decidim vulnerable to sensitive data disclosure
date: 2023-07-11
description: |-
  Note: added the actual report as a [comment](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/security/advisories/GHSA-jm79-9pm4-vrw9#advisory-comment-81110).

  ### Summary

  Decidim, a platform for digital citizen participation, uses a third-party library named Ransack for filtering certain database collections (e.g., public meetings). By default, this library allows filtering on all data attributes and associations. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to exfiltrate non-public data from the underlying database of a Decidim instance (e.g., exfiltrating data from the user table).

  ### Impact
  This issue may lead to Sensitive Data Disclosure.

  ### Patches
  The problem was patched in [v0.27.3](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/releases/tag/v0.27.3).

  ### Workarounds
  Disable or unpublish all meetings components from your application.
