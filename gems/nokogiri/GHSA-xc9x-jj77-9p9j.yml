title: Nokogiri update packaged libxml2 to v2.12.5 to resolve CVE-2024-25062
date: 2024-02-05
description: |-
  ## Summary

  Nokogiri v1.16.2 upgrades the version of its dependency libxml2 to [v2.12.5](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.5).

  libxml2 v2.12.5 addresses the following vulnerability:

  - CVE-2024-25062 / https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25062
    - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/604
    - patched by https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/92721970

  Please note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `< 1.16.2`, and only if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use _system_ libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` release announcements.

  ## Mitigation

  Upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.16.2`.

  Users who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri against external libraries libxml2 `>= 2.12.5` which will also address these same issues.

  ## Impact

  From the CVE description, this issue applies to the `xmlTextReader` module (which underlies `Nokogiri::XML::Reader`):

  > When using the XML Reader interface with DTD validation and XInclude expansion enabled, processing crafted XML documents can lead to an xmlValidatePopElement use-after-free.

  ## Timeline

  - 2024-02-04 10:35 EST - this GHSA is drafted without complete details about when the upstream issue was introduced; a request is made of libxml2 maintainers for more detailed information
  - 2024-02-04 10:48 EST - updated GHSA to reflect libxml2 maintainers' confirmation of affected versions
  - 2024-02-04 11:54 EST - v1.16.2 published, this GHSA made public
  - 2024-02-05 10:18 EST - updated with MITRE link to the CVE information, and updated "Impact" section
