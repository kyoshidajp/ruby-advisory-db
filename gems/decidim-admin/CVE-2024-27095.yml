title: Decidim cross-site scripting (XSS) in the admin panel
date: 2024-07-10
description: "### Impact\n\nThe admin panel is subject to potential XSS attach in
  case the attacker manages to modify some records being uploaded to the server.\n\nThe
  attacker is able to change  e.g. to `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>` if they know how
  to craft these requests themselves. And then enter the returned blob ID to the form
  inputs manually by modifying the edit page source.\n\n### Patches\n\nAvailable in
  versions 0.27.6 and 0.28.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nReview the user accounts that
  have access to the admin panel (i.e. general Administrators, and participatory space's
  Administrators) and remove access to them if they don't need it. \n\n### References\n\nOWASP
  ASVS v4.0.3-5.1.3\n"
