title: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere in ruby-mysql
date: 2022-06-29
description: A malicious actor can read arbitrary files from a client that uses ruby-mysql
  to communicate to a rogue MySQL server and issue database queries. In these cases,
  the server has the option to create a database reply using the LOAD DATA LOCAL statement,
  which instructs the client to provide additional data from a local file readable
  by the client (and not a "local" file on the server).
