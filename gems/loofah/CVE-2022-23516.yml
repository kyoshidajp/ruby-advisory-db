title: Uncontrolled Recursion in Loofah
date: 2022-12-13
description: |
  ## Summary

  Loofah `>= 2.2.0, < 2.19.1` uses recursion for sanitizing `CDATA` sections, making it susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a `SystemStackError` exception.  This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.


  ## Mitigation

  Upgrade to Loofah `>= 2.19.1`.

  Users who are unable to upgrade may be able to mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the length of the strings that are sanitized.


  ## Severity

  The Loofah maintainers have evaluated this as [High Severity 7.5 (CVSS3.1)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
