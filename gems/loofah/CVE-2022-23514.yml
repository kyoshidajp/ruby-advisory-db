title: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in Loofah
date: 2022-12-13
description: |
  ## Summary

  Loofah `< 2.19.1` contains an inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.


  ## Mitigation

  Upgrade to Loofah `>= 2.19.1`.
