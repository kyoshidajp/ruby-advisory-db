title: Possible Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack’s header parsing
date: 2023-03-15
description: |
  There is a denial of service vulnerability in the header parsing component of Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-27539.

  Versions Affected: >= 2.0.0 Not affected: None. Fixed Versions: 2.2.6.4, 3.0.6.1

  # Impact
  Carefully crafted input can cause header parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. Any applications that parse headers using Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted.

  # Workarounds
  Setting Regexp.timeout in Ruby 3.2 is a possible workaround.
