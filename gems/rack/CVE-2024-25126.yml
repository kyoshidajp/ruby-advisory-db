title: Rack vulnerable to ReDoS in content type parsing (2nd degree polynomial)
date: 2024-02-28
description: |-
  ### Summary

  ```ruby
  module Rack
    class MediaType
      SPLIT_PATTERN = %r{\s*[;,]\s*}
  ```

  The above regexp is subject to ReDos. 50K blank characters as a prefix to the header will take over 10s to split.

  ### PoC

  A simple HTTP request with lots of blank characters in the content-type header:

  ```ruby
  request["Content-Type"] = (" " * 50_000) + "a,"
  ```

  ### Impact

  It's a very easy to craft ReDoS. Like all ReDoS the impact is debatable.
