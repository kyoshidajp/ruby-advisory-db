description: While investigating UBSAN errors in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5365
  it was discovered Apache Arrow versions 0.12.0 to 0.14.1, left memory Array data
  uninitialized when reading RLE null data from parquet. This affected the C++, Python,
  Ruby and R implementations. The uninitialized memory could potentially be shared
  if are transmitted over the wire (for instance with Flight) or persisted in the
  streaming IPC and file formats.
