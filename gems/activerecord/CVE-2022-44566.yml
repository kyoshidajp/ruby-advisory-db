title: Denial of Service Vulnerability in ActiveRecord’s PostgreSQL adapter
date: 2023-01-18
description: |
  There is a potential denial of service vulnerability present in ActiveRecord’s PostgreSQL adapter.

  This has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-44566.

  Versions Affected: All. Not affected: None. Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.1, 6.1.7.1
  Impact

  In ActiveRecord <7.0.4.1 and <6.1.7.1, when a value outside the range for a 64bit signed integer is provided to the PostgreSQL connection adapter, it will treat the target column type as numeric. Comparing integer values against numeric values can result in a slow sequential scan resulting in potential Denial of Service.
  Releases

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.
  Workarounds

  Ensure that user supplied input which is provided to ActiveRecord clauses do not contain integers wider than a signed 64bit representation or floats.
