title: Race Condition leading to logging errors
date: 2023-05-01
description: "In certain setups with threaded web servers, Audited's use of `Thread.current`
  can incorrectly attributed audits to the wrong user. \n\nFixed in 5.3.3. \n\nIn
  March, @convisoappsec noticed that the library in question had a Race Condition
  problem, which caused logs to be registered at times with different users than those
  who performed the genuine actions.\n\n- The first issue we identified was from November
  2021: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/issues/601 \n- So the solution was
  implemented in the following Pull Request: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/669
  \n- And the feature was published in version 5.3.3: RELEASE: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/671\n"
