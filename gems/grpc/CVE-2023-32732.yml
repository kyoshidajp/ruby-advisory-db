title: gRPC connection termination issue
date: 2023-07-06
description: 'gRPC contains a vulnerability whereby a client can cause a termination
  of connection between a HTTP2 proxy and a gRPC server: a base64 encoding error for
  `-bin` suffixed headers will result in a disconnection by the gRPC server, but is
  typically allowed by HTTP2 proxies. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309.
