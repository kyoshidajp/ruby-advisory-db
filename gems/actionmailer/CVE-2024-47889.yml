date: 2024-10-15
description: |-
  There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the block_format helper in Action Mailer. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-47889.

  Impact
  ------

  Carefully crafted text can cause the block_format helper to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.
