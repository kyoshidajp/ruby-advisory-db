title: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
  in Pay
date: 2023-04-20
description: |
  ### Impact
  A payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site scripting. An attacker could create a working URL that renders a javascript link to a user on a Rails application that integrates Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target certain individuals. If the targeted application contains a functionality to submit user-generated content (such as comments) the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality.

  ### Patches
  This has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above.

  Pay will now sanitize the `back` parameter and only permit relative paths.
