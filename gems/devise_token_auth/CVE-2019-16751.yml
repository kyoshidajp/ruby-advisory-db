description: An issue was discovered in Devise Token Auth through 1.1.2. The omniauth
  failure endpoint is vulnerable to Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through the
  message parameter. Unauthenticated attackers can craft a URL that executes a malicious

  in the omniauth callbacks controller.
