title: Clockwork Web contains a Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability with Rails
  < 5.2
date: 2023-02-02
description: 'Clockwork Web before 0.1.2, when used with Rails before 5.2 is used,
  allows Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). A CSRF attack works by getting an authorized
  user to visit a malicious website and then performing requests on behalf of the
  user. In this instance, actions include enabling and disabling jobs. All users running
  an affected release on Rails < 5.2 should upgrade immediately.
