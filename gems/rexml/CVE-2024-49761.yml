title: REXML ReDoS vulnerability
date: 2024-10-28
description: |
  ### Impact

  The REXML gem before 3.3.9 has a ReDoS vulnerability when it parses an XML that has many digits between `&#` and `x...;` in a hex numeric character reference (`&#x...;`).

  This does not happen with Ruby 3.2 or later. Ruby 3.1 is the only affected maintained Ruby. Note that Ruby 3.1 will reach EOL on 2025-03.

  ### Patches

  The REXML gem 3.3.9 or later include the patch to fix the vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds

  Use Ruby 3.2 or later instead of Ruby 3.1.
