title: REXML denial of service vulnerability
date: 2024-08-22
description: |-
  ### Impact

  The REXML gem before 3.3.6 has a DoS vulnerability when it parses an XML that has many deep elements that have same local name attributes.

  If you need to parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API like `REXML::Document.new`, you may be impacted to this vulnerability. If you use other parser APIs such as stream parser API and SAX2 parser API, this vulnerability is not affected.

  ### Patches

  The REXML gem 3.3.6 or later include the patch to fix the vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds

  Don't parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API.
