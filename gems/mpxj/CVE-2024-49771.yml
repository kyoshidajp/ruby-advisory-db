title: MPXJ has a Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability
date: 2024-10-28
description: |
  ### Impact
  The patch for the historical vulnerability CVE-2020-35460 in MPXJ is incomplete as there is still a possibility that a malicious path could be constructed which would not be picked up by the original fix and allow files to be written to arbitrary locations.

  ### Patches
  The issue is addressed in MPXJ version 13.5.1

  ### Workarounds
  Do not pass zip files to MPXJ.

  ### References
  N/A
