title: Possible ReDoS vulnerability in plain_text_for_blockquote_node in Action Text
date: 2024-10-15
description: |-
  There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the plain_text_for_blockquote_node helper in Action Text. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-47888.

  Impact
  ------

  Carefully crafted text can cause the plain_text_for_blockquote_node helper to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.

  Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.


  Releases

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  Workarounds
  -----------
  Users can avoid calling `plain_text_for_blockquote_node` or upgrade to Ruby 3.2
