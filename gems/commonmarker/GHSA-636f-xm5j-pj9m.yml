title: Several quadratic complexity bugs may lead to denial of service in Commonmarker
date: 2023-01-24
description: |-
  ## Impact

  Several quadratic complexity bugs in commonmarker's underlying [`cmark-gfm`](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) library may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.

  The following vulnerabilities were addressed:

  * [CVE-2023-22483](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-29g3-96g3-jg6c)
  * [CVE-2023-22484](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-24f7-9frr-5h2r)
  * [CVE-2023-22485](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-c944-cv5f-hpvr)
  * [CVE-2023-22486](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-r572-jvj2-3m8p)

  For more information, consult the release notes for version [`0.23.0.gfm.7`](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/releases/tag/0.29.0.gfm.7).

  ## Mitigation

  Users are advised to upgrade to commonmarker version [`0.23.7`](https://rubygems.org/gems/commonmarker/versions/0.23.7).
