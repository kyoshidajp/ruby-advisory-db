title: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in rails-html-sanitizer
date: 2022-12-13
description: |
  ## Summary

  Certain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer `< 1.4.4` use an inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.


  ## Mitigation

  Upgrade to rails-html-sanitizer `>= 1.4.4`.


  ## Severity

  The maintainers have evaluated this as [High Severity 7.5 (CVSS3.1)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
