title: TZInfo relative path traversal vulnerability allows loading of arbitrary files
date: 2022-07-21
description: "### Impact\n\n#### Affected versions\n\n  - 0.3.60 and earlier.\n  -
  1.0.0 to 1.2.9 when used with the Ruby data source (tzinfo-data).\n\n#### Vulnerability
  \n\nWith the Ruby data source (the tzinfo-data gem for tzinfo version 1.0.0 and
  later and built-in to earlier versions), time zones are defined in Ruby files. There
  is one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand.
  In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifiers
  correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Ruby version
  1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with
  `require`, executing them within the Ruby process.\n\nFor example, with version
  1.2.9, you can run the following to load a file with path `/tmp/payload.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nTZInfo::Timezone.get(\"foo\\n/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/payload\")\n```\n\nThe
  exact number of parent directory traversals needed will vary depending on the location
  of the tzinfo-data gem.\n\nTZInfo versions 1.2.6 to 1.2.9 can be made to load files
  from outside of the Ruby load path. Versions up to and including 1.2.5 can only
  be made to load files from directories within the load path. \n\nThis could be exploited
  in, for example, a Ruby on Rails application using tzinfo version 1.2.9, that allows
  file uploads and has a time zone selector that accepts arbitrary time zone identifiers.
  The CVSS score and severity have been set on this basis.\n\nVersions 2.0.0 and later
  are not vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to
  correctly validate time zone identifiers.\n\nNote that version 0.3.61 can still
  load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name follows the rules for
  a valid time zone identifier and the file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within
  a directory in the load path. For example if `/tmp/upload` was in the load path,
  then `TZInfo::Timezone.get('foo')` could load a file with path `/tmp/upload/tzinfo/definition/foo.rb`.
  Applications should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a directory on
  the load path.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a workaround, the time zone identifier can
  be validated before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it matches the
  regular expression `\\A[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+(?:\\/[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+)*\\z`.\n\n### For
  more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n
  \ - Open an issue in [the tzinfo repository](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo)."
