title: Tarball permission preservation in puppet
date: 2022-05-13
description: |
  When installing a module using the system tar, the PMT will filter filesystem permissions to a sane value. This may just be based on the user's umask.

  When using minitar, files are unpacked with whatever permissions are in the tarball. This is potentially unsafe, as tarballs can be easily created with weird permissions.
