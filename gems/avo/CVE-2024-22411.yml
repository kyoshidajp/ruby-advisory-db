title: Cross-site scripting (XSS) in Action messages on Avo
date: 2024-01-17
description: Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps. In
  Avo 3 pre12 any HTML inside text that is passed to `error` or `succeed` in an `Avo::BaseAction`
  subclass will be rendered directly without sanitization in the toast/notification
  that appears in the UI on Action completion. A malicious user could exploit this
  vulnerability to trigger a cross site scripting attack on an unsuspecting user.
  This issue has been addressed in the 3.0.2 release of Avo. Users are advised to
  upgrade.
