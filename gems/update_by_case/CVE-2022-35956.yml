title: update_by_case before 0.1.3 can be vulnerable to sql injection
date: 2022-08-11
description: Before version 0.1.3 `update_by_case` gem used custom sql strings, and
  it was not sanitized, making it vulnerable to sql injection. Upgrade to version
  >= 0.1.3 that uses `Arel` instead to construct the resulting sql statement, with
  sanitized sql.
