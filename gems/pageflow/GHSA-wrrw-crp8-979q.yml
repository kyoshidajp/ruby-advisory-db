title: Pageflow vulnerable to sensitive user data extraction via Ransack query injection
date: 2022-09-15
description: "### Impact\n\nThe attack allows extracting sensitive properties of database
  objects that are associated with users or entries belonging to an account that the
  attacker has access to.\n\nPageflow uses the `ActiveAdmin` Ruby library to provide
  some management features to its users. `ActiveAdmin` relies on the `Ransack` library
  to implement search functionality. In its default configuration, `Ransack` will
  allow for query conditions based on properties of associated database objects [1].
  The `*_starts_with`, `*_ends_with` or `*_contains` search matchers [2] can then
  be abused to exfiltrate sensitive string values of associated database objects via
  character-by-character brute-force.\n\n[1] https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/going-further/associations/\n[2]
  https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/getting-started/search-matches/\n\n###
  Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to version 15.7.1 or 14.5.2 of the `pageflow` gem.\n\n###
