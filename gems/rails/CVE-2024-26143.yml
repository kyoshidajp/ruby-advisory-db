title: Rails has possible XSS Vulnerability in Action Controller
date: 2024-02-27
description: "# Possible XSS Vulnerability in Action Controller\n\nThere is a possible
  XSS vulnerability when using the translation helpers\n(`translate`, `t`, etc) in
  Action Controller. This vulnerability has been\nassigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26143.\n\nVersions
  Affected:  >= 7.0.0.\nNot affected:       < 7.0.0\nFixed Versions:     7.1.3.1,
  7.0.8.1\n\nImpact\n------\nApplications using translation methods like `translate`,
  or `t` on a\ncontroller, with a key ending in \"_html\", a `:default` key which
  contains\nuntrusted user input, and the resulting string is used in a view, may
  be\nsusceptible to an XSS vulnerability.\n\nFor example, impacted code will look
  something like this:\n\n```ruby\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\n
  \ def show  \n    @message = t(\"message_html\", default: untrusted_input)\n    #
  The `show` template displays the contents of `@message`\n  end\nend\n```\n\nTo reiterate
  the pre-conditions, applications must:\n\n* Use a translation function from a controller
  (i.e. _not_ I18n.t, or `t` from\n  a view)\n* Use a key that ends in `_html`\n*
  Use a default value where the default value is untrusted and unescaped input\n*
  Send the text to the victim (whether that's part of a template, or a\n  `render`
  call)\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one
  of the\nworkarounds immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed releases are available
  at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nThere are no feasible workarounds
  for this issue.\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately
  we have provided patches for\nthe two supported release series. They are in git-am
  format and consist of a\nsingle changeset.\n\n*  7-0-translate-xss.patch - Patch
  for 7.0 series\n*  7-1-translate-xss.patch - Patch for 7.1 series\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks
