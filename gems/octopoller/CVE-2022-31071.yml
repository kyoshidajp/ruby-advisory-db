title: Octopoller gem published with world-writable files
date: 2022-06-15
description: "### Impact\n\nVersion [0.2.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.2.0)
  of the octopoller gem was published containing world-writeable files. Specifically,
  the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e.
  0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644). \n\nThis means everyone who is not the
  owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance where this release had been
  installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem. \n\nMalicious code
  already present and running on your machine, separate from this package, could modify
  the gem’s files and change its behavior during runtime.\n\n### Patches\n* octopoller
  0.3.0\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can use the previous version of the gem [v0.1.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.1.0).
  Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able
  to upgrade to the latest version.\n\n"
